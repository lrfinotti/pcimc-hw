So, one can use them to replace the *last* two congruences with a single one, instead of the first two."

    "Here is the idea: If `v` has length 2, just use Sage's built in `xgcd` to get the GCD of the two elements and the two entries of the ouptut vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For *larger length* (all that comes now assumes that `v` has length greater than 2), we can use a [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)): we have that $\\gcd(a_1,a_2,\\ldots ,a_n) = \\gcd(a_1, \\gcd(a_2, \\ldots , a_n))$ (which we can get using `xgcd`, since the right-hand side has only two entries, $a_1$ and $\\gcd(a_2, \\ldots , a_n)$!).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, inside our function we call the function itself with `xea3(v[1:])` (where `v[1:]` just gives the vector `v` minus its first entry, i.e., $(a_2, \\ldots , a_n)$).  This gives some `e` (which is $\\gcd(a_2, \\ldots ,a_n)$) and a vector `w` (that gives the linear combination for this smaller vector), say $w = (t_2, \\ldots, t_n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `e` we can call `xgcd(v[0], e)`, which gives `g, r, s`, where `g` is the GCD of `v[0]` and `e` (so, the GCD of $a_1$ and $\\gcd(a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$, i.e., $\\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$ which we wanted), and `g = r*v[0] + s*e`.  So, we already have our GCD to give (namely, `g` above), and hence we just need the vector that gives the linear combination.  This is simply $(r, s \\cdot t_2, s \\cdot t_3 , \\ldots , s \\cdot t_n)$ (with $r$ and $s$ from this last call of `xgcd` and $t_i$'s from the vector `w` from the recursive call (in the above paragraph))."
